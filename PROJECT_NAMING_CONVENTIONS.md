# Project Naming Conventions

The chosen project name will define the name of the repository, the buddy project, the folder name on local machines and servers and more. Therefore it is important that we choose it wisely and name projects conistent to avoid confusion.

## General rules
* Only lowercase
* Dashes are the only special characters allowed
* No number character at the beginning
* No akronyms or abbreviations
* Our default environment is LEMP and as it is our default it must not be mentioned in the project name
* Non-default environments should be indicated at the end of the project name after an additional dash (like `ice-bash-invite-s3`, `hanx-101-mobile`)

## Examples

  ### Good
  * laravel-skeleton
  * m56-studios
  * telus-storyhive
  * caregiver-stories
  * ice-bash-invite-s3
 
  ### Bad
  * Laravel-Skeleton
  * icebash-website
  * cgs-project
