# TheCoupCompany Style Guide / Code Conventions

## PHP
We are following the common conventions:
* [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/)
* [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)
* [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)

We have no check for these in the built process (so far) but all developers are highly encouraged to follow those conventions to the best of their abilities.

Please set your IDE to use/check these code conventions: [PHPStorm / WebStorm](http://laraveldaily.com/how-to-configure-phpstorm-for-psr-2/)

## JavaScript
For JavaScript there are multiple conventions, we decided on the following:
* [AirBnB JavaScript Code Conventions](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* Inline JavaScript should follow [AirBnB JavaScript Code Conventions for ES5](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es5-deprecated/es5)

There is a prepared [.eslintrc file](https://github.com/TheCoupCompany/laravel-skeleton/blob/master/.eslintrc) in the root folder of the project.

We have no check for these in the built process (so far) but all developers are highly encouraged to follow those conventions to the best of their abilities.
